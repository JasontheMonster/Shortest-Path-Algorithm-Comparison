# Shortest-Path-Algorithm-Comparison
Implementation of Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra with Java


# Todo

1. Implementation of a graph class with Java:
        1. LinkedList
        2. add vertex
        3. add edges
        4. Get neighbors
        5. Ramdomize Graph

2. Implmentation of Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford

Initialize for each node v, dist(s; v) = 1
Initialize X = empty;, dist(s; s) = 0
for i = 1 to |V| do
Let v be such that dist(s; v) = minX dist(s; u)
X = X [ fvg
for each u in Adj(v) do
dist(s; u) = min
dist(s; u); dist(s; v) + l(v; u)


3. Comparision with library
